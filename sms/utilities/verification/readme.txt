The Table Verification utility is designed to verify that all the tables and
fields that should be in the SMS database are in fact there. If the database
table or field is not there, it will be created. This utility should be used
if you're consistently getting errors when trying to update.

To use this utility, unzip the file to your desktop then upload it to your
root SMS directory. Navigate to http://<yoursite>/tables.php and follow the
prompts. Once the verification is complete, delete the file from your server.

This utility is distributed by Anodyne Productions for use with the latest 
stable release of the SIMM Management System. Use of this utility with a 
version other than the latest stable versions is not recommended nor supported. 
Questions and support requests should be directed to the Anodyne Forums.
