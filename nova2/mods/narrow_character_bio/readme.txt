NOVA MOD - NARROW CHARACTER BIO PAGE

Changes made to the character bio pages may stretch beyond the bounds of
fixed width skins built off of some of the Nova 1 skins. In order to
correct this, you will need to use a narrower character bio page.

INSTALLATION

1. Connect to your server with your FTP program
2. Upload personnel_character.php to application/views/_base_override/main/pages

If you would prefer that only a specific skin has this MOD, upload the
PHP file to your skin's main/pages directory.
